      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-2">Posted on March 22nd, 2025 by Tanush Saraogi</p>
      <p class="mb-3">Our team has implemented the core logic for predicting NFL outcomes using historical data and machine learning. The web interface has been improved with a weekly update table for predictions. We also reviewed accuracy metrics and started planning model improvements. The tool is now hosted live for testing. Members are providing feedback for next steps.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-2">Posted on March 29th, 2025 by Ashwin Willy</p>
      <p class="mb-3">We launched our Hacker News keyword trends tracker. The project uses the Algolia API to analyze trending terms and display frequency charts. It includes search functionality, and the layout was refined based on member feedback. Future updates will add tag filtering and export options. Overall, the release went smoothly and drew attention from several classmates.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-2">Posted on April 5th, 2025 by Rohan Mishra</p>
      <p class="mb-3">We continued work on the Tennis Court Finder, implementing Firebase integration to store user input and location data. We also refactored some of the UI components to improve user experience. Teams are meeting twice a week now to keep momentum. We've added a new member to help with testing. It's shaping up to be our most polished app so far.</p>

Team members also learned about basic search engine optimization. Our next goal is to add individual post pages and user comments.

      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-2">Posted on April 19th, 2025 by Aryaveer Dhawan</p>
      <p class="mb-3">All three major Byteworks projects have reached version one. The Chrome extension team is wrapping up final bug fixes, and the UTR Matcher now supports over 100 schools. Members submitted documentation and recorded demo videos. These projects will be showcased at our end-of-year event. It’s a major step for everyone who contributed.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-2">Posted on April 26th, 2025 by Thomas Park</p>
      <p class="mb-3">With final exams approaching, we discussed how Byteworks can continue over the summer. Ideas included a mentoring program, open-source contributions, and smaller async builds. Members voted on priorities for summer planning. Leadership transitions will also begin next month. It’s been rewarding to reflect on how far the club has come.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-2">Posted on May 5th, 2025 by Armaan Gill</p>
      <p class="mb-3">Today we took a moment to appreciate how much the club has grown since February. From just an idea to three working tools, a full website, and 30+ members, it’s been a huge team effort. Every member played a role, whether in coding, writing, designing, or organizing. As we close out the semester, we’re already talking about next year’s roadmap. There’s a lot more we hope to build together.</p>
